**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Structure your report with clear sections for each of the analysis dimensions. Include specific examples, quantifiable metrics where possible, and cite your sources. Highlight both strengths and potential concerns. Conclude with an overall assessment of founder quality and investment readiness.

If you cannot find sufficient information for any particular analysis dimension or sub-point, simply omit that section rather than stating that information was not found.

Always maintain objectivity, verify information from multiple sources, and clearly distinguish between confirmed facts and reasonable inferences based on available data.
